NAME
----
lttng-add-trigger - Create LTTng triggers


SYNOPSIS
--------

[verse]
*lttng* ['linkgenoptions:(GENERAL OPTIONS)'] *add-trigger* [--id ID]
      [--fire-every N] [--fire-once-after N]
      --condition CONDITION-NAME CONDITION-ARGS
      --action ACTION-NAME ACTION-ARGS
      [--action ACTION-NAME ACTION-ARGS]...


DESCRIPTION
-----------

The `lttng add-trigger` command is used to create triggers.  A
trigger is an association between a *condition* and one or more
*actions*.  When the condition associated to a trigger is met, the
actions associated to that trigger are executed.  The tracing does not
have to be active for the conditions to be met, and triggers are
independent from tracing sessions.

By default, a trigger fires every time its condition is met.  The
'--fire-every' and '--fire-once-after' options can be used to change
this mode.

The syntax by which conditions and actions are specified is described
below.

[[conditions]]
Conditions
~~~~~~~~~~

Conditions are specified with the `--condition` option, followed by a
condition name, and possibly some more arguments, depending on the
specific condition.  There must be exactly one condition given in the
`lttng add-trigger` invocation.

The available conditions are:

Event rule: `on-event [event rule arguments]`::
    This type of condition is met when the tracer encounters an event
    matching the given even rule.  The arguments describing the event
    rule are the same as those describing the event rules of the
    man:lttng-enable-event(1) command, with these exceptions:

    - It is not possible to use filter operands that use values from
      the context.

[[actions]]
Actions
~~~~~~~

Actions are specified with the `--action` option, followed by an action
name, and possibly some more arguments, depending on the specific
action.  There must be at least one action given in the
`lttng add-trigger` invocation.

The available actions are:

Notify: *notify*::
    This action causes the LTTng session daemon to send a notification,
    through its notification mechanism (see man:lttng-sessiond(8)).
    Some details about the condition evaluation are sent along with the
    notification.

Start session: *start-session* session-name::
    This action causes the LTTng session daemon to start tracing for the
    session with the given name.  If no session with the given name exist
    at the time the condition is met, nothing is done.

Stop session: *stop-session* session-name::
    This action causes the LTTng session daemon to stop tracing for the
    session with the given name.  If no session with the given name exist
    at the time the condition is met, nothing is done.

Rotate session: *rotate-session* session-name::
    This action causes the LTTng session daemon to rotate the session
    with the given name.  See  man:lttng-rotate(1) for more information
    about the session rotation concept.  If no session with the given
    name exist at the time the condition is met, nothing is done.

Snapshot session: *snapshot-session* session-name::
    This action causes the LTTng session daemon to take a snapshot of the
    session with the given name.  See man:lttng-snapshot(1) for more
    information about the session snapshot concept.  If no session with
    the given name exist at the time the condition is met, nothing is
    done.

OPTIONS
-------

option:--condition::
    Define the condition for the trigger.  See the
    <<conditions,CONDITIONS>> section for more details.

option:--action::
    Define an action for the trigger.  See the <<actions,ACTIONS>>
    section for more details.

option:--id='ID'::
    Set the id of the trigger to 'ID'.  If omitted, an id will
    automatically be assigned to the trigger by the session daemon.
+
If a trigger with the specified 'ID' already exists, the trigger
creation will fail.

option:--fire-every 'N'::
    Execute the trigger's actions every 'N' times the condition is met.

option:--fire-once-after 'N'::
    Execute the trigger's actions once after 'N' times the condition is
    met, then never after that.
