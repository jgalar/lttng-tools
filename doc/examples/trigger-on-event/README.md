# Trigger notification example

## Description
This example is made-up of three executables.

### `notification-client`

```
Usage: notification-client TRIGGER_NAME TRIGGER_NAME2 ...
```

A simple client that subscribes to the notifications emitted by the `TRIGGER_NAME` trigger.

Multiple trigger names can be passed and subscribed to.


### `instrumented-app`

An application that emits the `trigger_example:my_event` event every 2 seconds.

### `demo.sh`

This script adds a trigger named `demo_trigger` which emits a notification when
the user-space `trigger_example:my_event` event occurs.

This script also adds a trigger named `demo_trigger_capture` which emits a
notification when the user-space `trigger_example:my_event` event occurs and
provides captured fields if present.

Once the triggers have been setup, the notification-client is launched to print
all notifications emitted by the `demo_trigger` and `demo_trigger_capture`
trigger.

## Building

Simply run the included Makefile.

## Running the example

1) Launch a session daemon using:
        ```
        $ lttng-sessiond
        ```
2) Launch the `demo.sh` script
3) Launch the `instrumented-app`

The following output should be produced:

```
$ ./demo.sh
